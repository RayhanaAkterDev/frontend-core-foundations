## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is a Fork?

- A **fork** is a personal copy of someone else‚Äôs repository on GitHub.  
- It allows you to freely experiment and make changes without affecting the original project.  
- Forks are essential for contributing to open-source projects or collaborating when you don‚Äôt have write permissions.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Fork Workflow

1. **Fork** the original repository on GitHub by clicking the **Fork** button on the repo page.  
2. **Clone** your forked repository to your local machine:  

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/forked-repo.git
   ```  

3. **Add the original repository as an upstream remote** to keep your fork updated:  

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/original-repo.git
   ```  

4. **Fetch and merge upstream changes** regularly to stay synced:  

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   ```  

5. **Create a feature branch** for your changes:  

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-branch
   ```  

6. **Make your changes**, commit, and push the feature branch to your fork:  

   ```bash
   git push origin feature-branch
   ```  

7. **Open a pull request** from your fork‚Äôs feature branch to the original repository‚Äôs main branch.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Keeping Your Fork Updated

- Regularly sync your fork with the original repository to avoid conflicts:  

  ```bash
  git fetch upstream
  git checkout main
  git merge upstream/main
  git push origin main
  ```
