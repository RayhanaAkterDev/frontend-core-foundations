## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is Git Stash?

- **Git stash** allows you to save your current uncommitted changes temporarily.  
- Useful when you need to switch context or branches but aren‚Äôt ready to commit incomplete work.  
- Saves both staged and unstaged changes (by default).

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Basic Stashing

To stash changes:

```bash
git stash
```

- Saves your changes and cleans your working directory to the last commit state.  
- Gives a stash name like `stash@{0}` for reference.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Listing Stashes

See all saved stashes with:

```bash
git stash list
```

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Applying Stashes

To reapply the most recent stash without removing it:

```bash
git stash apply
```

To apply a specific stash:

```bash
git stash apply stash@{2}
```

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Popping Stashes

Apply and remove the latest stash from the stash list:

```bash
git stash pop
```

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Creating Named Stashes

Give a descriptive message to your stash:

```bash
git stash push -m "WIP: fixing header layout"
```

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Stashing Specific Paths

Stash changes only from specific files or directories:

```bash
git stash push <file1> <dir2>
```

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Dropping and Clearing Stashes

- Remove a specific stash:

  ```bash
  git stash drop stash@{0}
  ```

- Remove all stashes:

  ```bash
  git stash clear
  ```
