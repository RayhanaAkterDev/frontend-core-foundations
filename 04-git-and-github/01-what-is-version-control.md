## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is Git?

Git is a **distributed version control system** (DVCS) designed to track changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work simultaneously on a project without overwriting each other's changes.

**Key characteristics of Git:**

- **Distributed:** Every developer has a full copy of the entire repository history locally.
- **Fast and efficient:** Optimized for performance, Git handles large projects quickly.
- **Branching & merging:** Lightweight branches make experimenting easy and safe.
- **Data integrity:** Uses SHA-1 hashes to ensure data is not corrupted.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ What is GitHub?

GitHub is a **cloud-based platform** built on top of Git to host repositories remotely. It provides:

- **Centralized collaboration:** Share your repositories and collaborate with others easily.
- **Pull requests:** Code review and discussion mechanism before merging changes.
- **Issue tracking:** Bug reports, feature requests, and project management tools.
- **CI/CD integration:** Automated workflows with GitHub Actions.
- **GitHub Pages:** Free hosting for static sites directly from repos.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Why Use Git and GitHub in Frontend Development?

Modern frontend projects require:

- **Version control:** Track changes to HTML, CSS, JS files, and assets over time.
- **Collaboration:** Multiple developers can contribute features or fixes in parallel.
- **Backup:** Remote repositories prevent data loss.
- **Deployment workflows:** Use GitHub Pages or CI/CD to deploy live sites automatically.
- **Open source contribution:** Engage with a vast ecosystem of frontend libraries and tools.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Key Concepts Overview

| Term              | Description                                                                                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Repository (Repo) | A project folder tracked by Git, containing all files and history.                         |
| Commit            | A snapshot of changes with a message describing what was done.                             |
| Branch            | A parallel version of the repository for independent work.                                 |
| Merge             | Combining changes from one branch into another.                                            |
| Remote            | A version of the repository hosted on GitHub or another server.                            |
| Pull Request (PR) | A request to merge changes from one branch or fork into another, often with review.        |

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ How Git and GitHub Work Together

- You make changes locally and **commit** them in Git.
- You **push** commits to the remote GitHub repository to share changes.
- Others **pull** your changes and collaborate.
- Use **branches** and **pull requests** on GitHub to review and merge features safely.
