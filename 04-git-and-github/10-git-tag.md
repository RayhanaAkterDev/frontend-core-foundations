## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is a Git Tag?

- A **tag** is a reference to a specific commit, usually used to mark release points (e.g., v1.0, v2.1).  
- Tags are like bookmarks that help identify significant versions in your project‚Äôs history.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Types of Tags

- **Lightweight tags:** Simple pointers to a commit, no extra metadata.  
- **Annotated tags:** Full objects stored in Git database, including tagger name, email, date, and a message. Recommended for releases.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Creating Tags

- **Create a lightweight tag:**

  ```bash
  git tag <tagname>
  ```

- **Create an annotated tag:**

  ```bash
  git tag -a <tagname> -m "Release version 1.0"
  ```

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Listing Tags

To list all tags in the repository:

```bash
git tag
```

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Viewing Tag Details

To see details of an annotated tag:

```bash
git show <tagname>
```

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Sharing Tags with Remote

Tags are **not** pushed by default when pushing branches. To push tags:

- Push a specific tag:

  ```bash
  git push origin <tagname>
  ```

- Push all tags:

  ```bash
  git push origin --tags
  ```

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Checking Out Tags

You can checkout a tag to view the project at that point, but this puts you in a **detached HEAD** state (no branch):

```bash
git checkout <tagname>
```

To create a new branch from a tag:

```bash
git checkout -b <new-branch-name> <tagname>
```

## üßæ Summary

Git tags are essential for marking important commits like releases or milestones.  
Annotated tags are preferred for release versions as they carry metadata and messages.
