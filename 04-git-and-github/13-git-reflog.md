## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is Git Reflog?

- **Git Reflog** is a reference log that records all changes made to the tips of branches and HEAD‚Äîeven those not visible in `git log`.
- It allows you to **recover commits** that have been lost due to `reset`, `rebase`, `amend`, or branch deletion.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Viewing the Reflog

```bash
git reflog
```

- Shows a timeline of all recent HEAD changes.
- Each entry includes:
  - Reference ID (e.g., `HEAD@{2}`)
  - Commit hash
  - Action description (`checkout`, `commit`, `reset`, etc.)

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Recovering a Lost Commit

If you accidentally removed a commit (e.g., via `reset --hard`), use its reflog reference to recover it:

```bash
git checkout HEAD@{2}
```

Or create a new branch from the lost commit:

```bash
git branch recover-branch HEAD@{2}
```

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Using Commit Hashes from Reflog

You can also copy the **commit hash** from the reflog entry and check it out or create a new branch:

```bash
git checkout <commit-hash>
git branch recovered <commit-hash>
```

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Clear Reflog (Optional)

To clear the reflog history:

```bash
git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git gc --prune=now --aggressive
```

‚ö†Ô∏è This is permanent‚Äîonly use when sure you won‚Äôt need the reflog again.

## üßæ Summary

Git Reflog is an essential safety net for recovering lost work.  
It tracks all HEAD movements, allowing you to restore commits even after destructive operations like reset or rebase.
