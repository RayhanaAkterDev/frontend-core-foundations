## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What are GitHub Actions?

- GitHub Actions allow you to automate tasks in your software development lifecycle.  
- You define workflows triggered by events like pushes, pull requests, or schedules.  
- Workflows consist of jobs and steps running on virtual machines or containers.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Key Concepts

- **Workflow:** YAML file stored in `.github/workflows/` that defines automation.  
- **Job:** A set of steps that run on the same runner (machine).  
- **Step:** An individual task, like running a script or action.  
- **Runner:** A machine that executes jobs (GitHub-hosted or self-hosted).  
- **Actions:** Reusable commands or scripts you include in workflows.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Basic Workflow Example

A simple workflow triggered on every push to `main` branch:

```yaml

    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '16'
    - run: npm install
    - run: npm test
```
