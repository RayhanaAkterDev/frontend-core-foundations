## 1Ô∏è‚É£ `git reset` ‚Äî Move HEAD and optionally modify index and working directory

- `git reset` changes which commit your current branch points to (moves HEAD).  
- Can be used to unstage files or undo commits locally.

**Common uses**:

- **Unstage files** (keep changes in working directory):

  ```bash
  git reset HEAD <file>
  ```

- **Soft reset** (undo commits but keep changes staged):

  ```bash
  git reset --soft <commit>
  ```

- **Mixed reset (default)** (undo commits and unstage changes, keep working directory):

  ```bash
  git reset <commit>
  ```

- **Hard reset** (undo commits and discard all local changes):

  ```bash
  git reset --hard <commit>
  ```

‚ö†Ô∏è Be cautious: `--hard` will delete local changes permanently.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ `git revert` ‚Äî Create a new commit that undoes a previous commit

- Safely undo changes by creating a new commit that reverses the effects of an earlier commit.  
- Useful when working with shared/public repositories.

```bash
git revert <commit>
```

- Opens an editor to write a commit message for the revert.  
- Keeps project history intact and avoids rewriting commit history.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ `git restore` ‚Äî Undo changes in the working directory or staging area

- Introduced in Git 2.23 as a clearer way to undo changes locally.

**Common uses**:

- **Discard unstaged changes** (restore file to last commit):

  ```bash
  git restore <file>
  ```

- **Unstage a file** (remove from staging area but keep changes):

  ```bash
  git restore --staged <file>
  ```

## üßæ Summary

- Use `git reset` for powerful, low-level undoing including changing branch HEAD and index state.  
- Use `git revert` to safely undo changes in public/shared history by creating new commits.  
- Use `git restore` for easier, intuitive undoing of local working directory and staging changes.  

Choose commands based on whether you want to rewrite history or just fix local edits.
