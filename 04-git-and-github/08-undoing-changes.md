# Undoing Changes (reset, revert, restore)

> Tags: git, undo, reset, revert, restore, version-control  
> **Purpose:** Explain different Git commands to undo changes safely and effectively in various situations, from discarding local edits to undoing commits.

---

## 1️⃣ `git reset` — Move HEAD and optionally modify index and working directory

- `git reset` changes which commit your current branch points to (moves HEAD).  
- Can be used to unstage files or undo commits locally.

**Common uses**:

- **Unstage files** (keep changes in working directory):

  ```bash
  git reset HEAD <file>
  ```

- **Soft reset** (undo commits but keep changes staged):

  ```bash
  git reset --soft <commit>
  ```

- **Mixed reset (default)** (undo commits and unstage changes, keep working directory):

  ```bash
  git reset <commit>
  ```

- **Hard reset** (undo commits and discard all local changes):

  ```bash
  git reset --hard <commit>
  ```

⚠️ Be cautious: `--hard` will delete local changes permanently.

## 2️⃣ `git revert` — Create a new commit that undoes a previous commit

- Safely undo changes by creating a new commit that reverses the effects of an earlier commit.  
- Useful when working with shared/public repositories.

```bash
git revert <commit>
```

- Opens an editor to write a commit message for the revert.  
- Keeps project history intact and avoids rewriting commit history.

---

## 3️⃣ `git restore` — Undo changes in the working directory or staging area

- Introduced in Git 2.23 as a clearer way to undo changes locally.

**Common uses**:

- **Discard unstaged changes** (restore file to last commit):

  ```bash
  git restore <file>
  ```

- **Unstage a file** (remove from staging area but keep changes):

  ```bash
  git restore --staged <file>
  ```

---

## 4️⃣ 🔥 Delete the Last Commit (Local History Rewriting)

To completely remove the most recent commit from your branch and local history:

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

This removes the last commit **and** resets your working directory to match the previous state.

If you've already pushed the commit to GitHub:

```bash
git push --force
```

> ⚠️ Force-pushing rewrites public history and should be done with caution, especially on shared branches.

---

## 🧾 Summary

- Use `git reset` for powerful, low-level undoing including changing branch HEAD and index state.  
- Use `git revert` to safely undo changes in public/shared history by creating new commits.  
- Use `git restore` for easier, intuitive undoing of local working directory and staging changes.  
- Use `git reset --hard HEAD~1` to **permanently delete** the most recent commit in your local history.

Choose commands based on whether you want to rewrite history or just fix local edits.
