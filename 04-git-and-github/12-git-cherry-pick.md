## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is Git Cherry-pick?

- **Git cherry-pick** allows you to select specific commits from one branch and apply them onto your current branch.  
- Useful for applying bug fixes or features selectively without merging all changes.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Basic Cherry-pick Usage

To cherry-pick a single commit:

```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

This applies the changes from that commit on top of your current branch as a new commit.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Cherry-pick Multiple Commits

You can cherry-pick a range of commits by specifying the start and end commit hashes:

```bash
git cherry-pick <start-commit>^..<end-commit>
```

This applies all commits from `<start-commit>` (exclusive) up to `<end-commit>` (inclusive).

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Handling Conflicts

- If conflicts occur during cherry-pick, Git will pause and notify you.  
- Resolve conflicts manually, stage the changes:

  ```bash
  git add <file>
  ```

- Then continue the cherry-pick:

  ```bash
  git cherry-pick --continue
  ```

- To abort the cherry-pick process:

  ```bash
  git cherry-pick --abort
  ```

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Cherry-pick with Commit Message Editing

To edit the commit message during cherry-pick:

```bash
git cherry-pick -e <commit-hash>
```
