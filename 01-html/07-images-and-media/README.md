## Detailed Explanation of Core Elements

- **Images (`<img>`)**  
  Display static visuals. Can use absolute URLs or relative paths. Important attributes include `src`, `alt` (for accessibility), `width`, `height`, `loading="lazy"` for performance optimization, and `title`.

- **Audio (`<audio>`)**  
  Plays sound files with controls for play, pause, volume, etc. Use `<source>` for different audio formats. Always provide fallback text for unsupported browsers.

- **Video (`<video>`)**  
  Displays video with customizable controls. Attributes like `autoplay`, `loop`, and `muted` improve user experience. Include fallback text for unsupported browsers.

- **Embedded Content (`<iframe>`)**  
  Used to embed external content like YouTube videos. Important attributes include `src`, `title` (for accessibility), `loading="lazy"` for performance, and security attributes like `referrerpolicy` and `allow`.
