## Detailed Explanation of Core Elements

### 1. `<script>` Tag Basics

- The `<script>` element is used to embed or reference executable JavaScript code in an HTML document.
- It can be placed in the `<head>` or at the end of the `<body>`.

### 2. Inline JavaScript

- JavaScript can be written directly inside a `<script>` tag.
- This is useful for short scripts or quick DOM manipulations.
- Example:

```html
  <script>
    document.getElementById('demo').textContent = 'Hello from inline JavaScript!';
  </script>
```

### 3. External JavaScript

- For better maintainability, JS code is usually written in external files and linked via the src attribute.
- Example:

```html
<script src="scripts/script.js"></script>
```

### 4. Script Placement

- Scripts in the `<head>` run before HTML content is loaded unless deferred.
- Scripts at the end of `<body>` run after the HTML is parsed, which is generally recommended for DOM manipulation.

> - Avoid using alert() for debugging‚Äîuse console.log() instead.
> - Always place scripts at the end of the body or use defer in the `<head>` to avoid blocking page load.
> - Keep JavaScript in external files for cleaner HTML and reusable code.
