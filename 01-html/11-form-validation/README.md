> **Purpose:** To understand and implement native HTML5 form validation attributes for client-side validation without relying on JavaScript.

## Overview

Form validation is essential to ensure that users provide the correct data before submitting a form. HTML5 offers built-in validation attributes such as `required`, `pattern`, `minlength`, `min`, and `max` that allow developers to enforce input rules without writing any JavaScript code. This enhances user experience by giving immediate feedback and improves accessibility.

## Detailed Explanation of Core Elements

- `<form>`  
  The container for all form elements. Omitting the `novalidate` attribute enables native validation by default.

- `<fieldset>` and `<legend>`  
  These group related inputs and provide descriptive labels for accessibility and better structure.

- Input attributes for validation:  
  - `required` — Makes the input mandatory before submission.  
  - `pattern` — Defines a regex pattern the input must match.  
  - `minlength` — Sets the minimum number of characters for text inputs.  
  - `min` and `max` — Define numeric input boundaries.  
  - `title` — Provides guidance on expected input format, shown on validation errors.  

- Checkbox with `required` — Used to ensure users accept terms or agreements.
