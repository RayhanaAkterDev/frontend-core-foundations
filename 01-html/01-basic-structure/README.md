## Overview

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundational markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages. It is not a programming language but a standardized system for tagging text files to achieve font, color, graphic, and hyperlink effects on web pages.

## Detailed Explanation of Core Elements

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`  
  Declares the document type and version as HTML5, enabling browsers to render the page in standards mode.

- `<html lang="en">`  
  The root element that wraps all other content. The `lang` attribute specifies the primary language of the document, which improves accessibility and SEO.

- `<head>`  
  Contains metadata and references essential for the document but not visible directly on the page. Typical elements include:

  - `<meta charset="UTF-8">`  
    Defines the character encoding to ensure correct display of text and symbols.

  - `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`  
    Configures viewport settings for responsive design across devices.

  - `<meta name="description" content="...">`  
    Provides a brief description of the page content to improve SEO and search engine snippets.

  - `<meta name="author" content="...">`  
    Identifies the document‚Äôs author.

  - `<meta name="keywords" content="...">`  
    Specifies relevant keywords (note: modern search engines largely ignore this).

- `<title>`  
  Sets the title of the webpage shown on the browser tab and used by search engines.

- `<body>`  
  Encloses all visible content such as text, images, links, and interactive elements that users interact with.
