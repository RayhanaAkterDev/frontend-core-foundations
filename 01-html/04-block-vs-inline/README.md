# Block vs Inline Elements

> **Purpose:** To understand and visualize the core difference between block-level and inline-level HTML elements through practical examples.

## Overview

HTML elements are categorized into two main types based on how they are rendered in the document flow: **block elements** and **inline elements**. Block elements start on a new line and stretch to fill the container‚Äôs width, while inline elements flow within a line and occupy only the space needed by their content.

Understanding this distinction is essential for controlling layout and flow in an HTML document.

## Detailed Explanation of Core Concepts

### **Block Elements**

- Render on a new line by default.
- Occupy the full width of their parent container.
- Can contain other block or inline elements.
- Examples: `<div>`, `<p>`, `<section>`, `<h1>`‚Äì`<h6>`, `<ul>`, `<blockquote>`.

### **Inline Elements**

- Do not break the line; flow alongside other inline content.
- Only take up as much width as necessary.
- Cannot contain block-level elements.
- Examples: `<span>`, `<a>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<img>`.

### **Key Visual Difference**

- Block elements stack vertically.
- Inline elements remain side-by-side unless wrapping occurs.
