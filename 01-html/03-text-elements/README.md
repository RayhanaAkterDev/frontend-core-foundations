## Overview

HTML text elements extend the functionality of block-level content by adding inline formatting and semantic meaning. Elements like `<br>` and `<hr>` control text flow and visual breaks, while `<strong>` and `<em>` provide emphasis to improve meaning, accessibility, and SEO.

---

## Detailed Explanation of Core Elements

- `<br>` - Inserts a line break, forcing text to continue on a new line without starting a new paragraph.

- `<hr>` - Creates a thematic break or horizontal rule to separate content sections visually.

- `<strong>` - Indicates important text with strong emphasis, often rendered bold by browsers.

- `<em>` - Marks text with emphasis, typically rendered italicized.

- `<strong><em>` - Combined strong and emphasized text for extra semantic weight.
