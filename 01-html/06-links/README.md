This topic covers common anchor usages and best practices for accessibility and user experience.

## Detailed Explanation of Core Examples

- **Basic External Link**  
  Links to external websites, often opening in a new tab using `target="_blank"` with security attributes `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.

- **Internal Anchor Link**  
  Links that jump to specific sections within the same page using fragment identifiers (`href="#id"`).

- **Email Link (`mailto:`)**  
  Opens the user‚Äôs default email client to send an email to the specified address.

- **Telephone Link (`tel:`)**  
  Enables calling a phone number directly on supported devices like smartphones.

- **Block Element Wrapped Link**  
  HTML5 allows wrapping block-level elements inside an `<a>` tag, making entire content blocks clickable.

- **Back to Top Anchor**  
  Internal navigation link to quickly return to the top of the page or another anchor.
