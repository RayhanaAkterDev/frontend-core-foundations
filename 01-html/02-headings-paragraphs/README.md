## Overview

Headings and paragraphs are fundamental block-level elements in HTML that organize and structure content on a web page. Headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) define a hierarchy of importance, helping users and search engines understand the page structure. Paragraphs (`<p>`) group sentences into readable blocks, improving clarity and accessibility.

## Detailed Explanation of Core Elements

- `<h1> … <h6>`  
  Represent six levels of section headings. `<h1>` is the highest (most important) level, typically used once per page for the main title. `<h6>` is the least important and used for minor headings.

- `<p>`  
  Defines a paragraph of text. Paragraphs help divide content into logical blocks, enhancing readability and accessibility.
