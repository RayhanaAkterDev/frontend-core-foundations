            <p>
                Responsive web design is a modern web development approach that
                ensures websites look and work well across a variety of devices
                and screen sizes. The viewport meta tag plays a crucial role in
                controlling how a webpage is displayed on mobile devices.

                <h2>What is Responsive Design?</h2>
                <p>
                    Responsive design means creating web layouts that adapt
                    fluidly to different screen sizes, from large desktop
                    monitors to small smartphone screens. This is typically
                    achieved using flexible grids, images, and CSS media
                    queries.

                <h2>The Viewport Meta Tag</h2>
                <p>
                    The viewport meta tag instructs the browser on how to
                    control the page's dimensions and scaling on mobile devices.
                </p>
                <!-- Code example showing the viewport meta tag syntax -->
                <pre><code>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;</code></pre>
                <p>Explanation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>width=device-width</code> sets the viewport width
                        to the device's screen width.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>initial-scale=1.0</code> sets the initial zoom
                        level when the page is first loaded.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why Is the Viewport Meta Tag Important?</h2>
                <p>
                    Without the viewport meta tag, mobile browsers may display
                    web pages with a desktop screen width scaled down, making
                    content appear tiny and hard to read. Using this tag helps
                    ensure the layout fits properly on smaller screens.

                    Resize the browser window or open this page on different
                    devices to see the responsive behavior.

                <div class="responsive-box">
                    This box resizes according to the viewport width.
