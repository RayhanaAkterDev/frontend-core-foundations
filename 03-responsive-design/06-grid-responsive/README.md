## 📖 Overview

CSS Grid provides powerful tools to build complex and responsive web layouts. This topic covers advanced features such as semantic grid areas, flexible track sizing with fractional units and minmax(), dynamic grid creation using auto-fit and auto-fill, nested grids, and media query integration for responsive design.

## 🛠️ Detailed Explanation of Core Elements

### Grid Template Areas

- Define named areas for parts of the layout to create semantic and readable grid structure.
- Example: `grid-template-areas: "header header header" "sidebar content ads" "footer footer footer";`

### Fractional Units (fr) and minmax()

- Use `fr` units to distribute space proportionally.
- `minmax(min, max)` sets flexible track sizes with minimum and maximum limits.

### Auto-fill and Auto-fit

- Dynamically fill grid container with as many tracks as possible.
- `auto-fit` collapses empty tracks; `auto-fill` preserves them for layout consistency.

### Nested Grids

- Create grids inside grid items to build complex, multi-level layouts.

### Media Queries with CSS Grid

- Adjust grid layout for different viewport sizes by redefining grid-template-columns and areas.

## 💡 Pro Tip

1. Use named grid areas for better maintainability and readability.
2. Combine `minmax()` with `auto-fit` for fully responsive, flexible grids.
3. Use nested grids to separate concerns in complex layouts.
4. Test layouts on various screen sizes and orientations.
5. Use browser dev tools grid inspectors to visualize grid lines and areas.
