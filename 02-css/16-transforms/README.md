# üé® CSS Transforms (translate, rotate, scale, skew)

> Tags: css, transforms, translate, rotate, scale, skew, transition  
> **Purpose:** This topic explains CSS transform functions that let you move, rotate, resize, and skew elements to create dynamic visual effects and interactions.

## üìñ Overview

CSS transforms allow manipulation of elements in 2D and 3D space without affecting the document flow. You can translate (move), rotate, scale (resize), and skew (slant) elements using the `transform` property. These transformations can be smoothly animated with CSS transitions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Detailed Explanation of Core Elements

### Translate

- Moves an element from its current position along the X and Y axes using `translate(x, y)`.
- Can be used with units like px, %, em.
- Example: `transform: translate(50px, 20px);`

### Rotate

- Rotates an element around a fixed point (by default, the center) using `rotate(angle)`.
- Angle units can be degrees (`deg`) or radians (`rad`).
- Example: `transform: rotate(30deg);`

### Scale

- Resizes an element in the X and Y directions using `scale(x, y)`.
- Values greater than 1 enlarge, between 0 and 1 shrink.
- Example: `transform: scale(1.5);`

### Skew

- Skews an element along the X and Y axes using `skew(x-angle, y-angle)`.
- Creates a slanted effect.
- Example: `transform: skew(20deg, 10deg);`

### Combined Transforms

- Multiple transforms can be combined in one declaration, executed from right to left.
- Example: `transform: translate(30px, 10px) rotate(20deg) scale(1.3);`

## üí° Pro Tip

- Always use `transform-origin` to adjust the pivot point for rotations and scaling when necessary.
- Combine transforms thoughtfully to avoid confusing UI effects.
- Use CSS transitions on `transform` to animate changes smoothly.
- Remember transforms do not affect document flow, so space occupied by the element remains the same.
